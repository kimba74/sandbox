The Sandbox
===========

## Concurrency
Examples covering Java concurrency, thread life-cycle management, and thread runtime behavior. Java5 and
Java7 introduced enhancements to the already existing Basic Concurrency capabilities and placed them in
the new `java.util.concurrency` package and its sub-packages. This section explores some of the Concurrency
functionality offered by the Java Language and experiments with some of the newer and more advanced features.
  
Standard Java concurrency functionality:  
[Examples _Java_](src/main/java/org/soabridge/reference/general/concurrency)

New `java.util.concurrency` package functionality (e.g. Locks, Executors, Callables)  
[Examples _Java5_](src/main/java/org/soabridge/reference/java5/concurrency)  
  
Additional functionality added to `java.util.concurrency` package functionality (e.g. ForkJoin and Phaser)
[Examples _Java7_](src/main/java/org/soabridge/reference/java7/concurrency)
